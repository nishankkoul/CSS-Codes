Box shadow style code:  
box-shadow: h-offset v-offset blur spread color inset;

Here,
- h-offset and v-offset represent shadow's horizontal and vertical position
- blur: larger the value, blurier the shadow
- spread: expands or shrinks the shadow size
- color represents the shadows color
- inset: makes the shadow inner

Similar to box shadow we can also give text-shadow

Borders and Outlines are very similar including the style code: the basic differences are: 
- Position: Outlines don't take up any space, they're drawn around the element outside of any border 
- Rounder Corners: Borders can have rounded borders whereas outlines cannot
- Width: Borders can have varying widths whereas Outlines have a uniform Width
- Offset: Using the outline offset property, you can set the space bw an outline and the edge of a boundary of an element.
